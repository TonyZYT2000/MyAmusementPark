# My Amusement Park

## Description

This is the third project of [CSE167](http://ivl.calit2.net/wiki/index.php/CSE167F2020), an introductory computer graphic course taught in UCSD by Professor Schulze. It implements skybox, environment mapping and scene graph animation. It also constructs a weird maniac amusement park ride composed of basic geometric shapes and the famous Utah teapot. Models are rendered under Phong shading model with different colors and reflection rates.

## Build

The project is managed using Visual Studio on Win10. It depends on OpenGL, GLEW and GLM. With these dependencies configured correctly, this project should also be able to run on OS X and Linux. Instructions can be found [here](http://ivl.calit2.net/wiki/index.php/BasecodeCSE167F20).
